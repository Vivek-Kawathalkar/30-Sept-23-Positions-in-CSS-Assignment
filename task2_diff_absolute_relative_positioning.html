    <!--
        Relative:
        1.Respects the normal document flow.
        2.Offsets are relative to the element's original position in the document flow.
        3.Useful when you want to move an element from its normal position.

        Absolute:
        1.Removed from the normal document flow.
        2.Position is determined by the nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
        3.Useful when you want precise positioning relative to a parent container or the viewport.
